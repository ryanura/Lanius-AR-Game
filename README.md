# Lanius-AR-Game
A simple Point Defense AR game using Vuforia library. Player need to scan the stage card to spawn the level on top of it and then begin the game shortly after. Multiple waves of enemies will spawn and slowly advance through the forest maze to character's home. Tap the enemy to attack and cause a little knockback effect until it dissappear. Utilize the character's skills such as Fortify (nullifies damage done by enemy to player base) and Thunder (deals heavy damage to all enemies). The goal is to defend the character's home from incoming waves of enemies. And if the base's HP reaches zero, the player loses the game.
